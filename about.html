      <h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
      <p>OMORI is a young boy who wears a black tank top, long black socks, and black and white striped shorts. He is the only character to be colored black and white in contrast with the colorful residents of HEADSPACE, and he is also the only character to have blank eyes with no pupils. His overall design stems from SUNNY's twelve-year-old appearance.</p>
      <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
      <p>Not much can be said about OMORI's personality, as he is a silent protagonist. However, it is implied that he is quite melancholic, as his narration sometimes has gloomy inputs, the overall tone left by the summary, and his final battle dialogue is directly talking down to SUNNY. His abilities are also reflective of this gloominess, being either violent in nature or simply gaining the SAD emotion, or having an advantage while SAD. However, it can be speculated that this is moreso reflective of SUNNY's emotional state, as OMORI is a character built from SUNNY'S conscience in WHITE SPACE and HEADSPACE.</p>

      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Technology</strong> at the
        <strong>Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology</strong>. I embarked on this journey in 2024 and have
        gained invaluable knowledge in web development, programming, and digital communication. My courses have equipped
        me with the skills to understand both the technical and creative aspects of technology, and I am excited to apply
        them in real-world projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to university, I completed my <strong>Senior High School</strong> at [Your SHS Name], where I focused on the
        [Your Strand] strand. The experience helped me develop a strong foundation in various subjects, especially in
        mathematics, technology, and communication. This education has inspired me to pursue a career that blends my
        interest in technology with my passion for problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        My <strong>Junior High School</strong> journey took place at [Your JHS Name]. It was during these years that I first
        became interested in technology and started exploring coding, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in ICT.
        The teachers and curriculum were fundamental in shaping my early academic interests, and I’ll always be grateful for
        the foundation they provided me.
      </p>

  <section id="exp" class="w-100 py-4" style="margin: 0; padding: 0 20px;">
    <div class = "biog">
      <a href="#exp">Experience</a><hr style="color: white;">
      <p>
        My professional journey began with an <strong>internship at [Company Name]</strong> in [Year], where I worked as
        a web development intern. During my time there, I was involved in designing and developing several small web
        projects, collaborating with a talented team of developers and designers. This internship gave me hands-on experience
        with front-end development, coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and understanding the workflow of a
        professional development environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my internship, I have also worked as a <strong>volunteer web developer</strong> for a local
        organization, [Organization Name]. Here, I assisted in building a website to promote the organization's mission and
        increase its online visibility. This experience enhanced my problem-solving and teamwork abilities, as I collaborated
        with a group of passionate individuals to create a functional, aesthetically pleasing site.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a <strong>freelance web developer</strong>, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, from designing
        personal blogs to creating portfolio websites for other developers. Through these freelance gigs, I have been able to
        refine my skills, learn new tools, and understand the needs of clients. Each project has challenged me to think
        creatively and work efficiently, and I look forward to taking on more projects in the future.
      </p>

    <div class = "biog">
      <a href="#achieve">Achievement</a><hr style="color: white;">
      <p>
        One of my most rewarding achievements was completing the <strong>Responsive Web Design Certification</strong> from
        FreeCodeCamp. This course enhanced my skills in creating flexible, user-friendly websites that adapt to various
        screen sizes. I gained a deeper understanding of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries, and I am proud of the
        projects I completed during the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, I participated in the <strong>National Coding Competition</strong> and placed second. It was an exciting
        opportunity to showcase my coding skills and learn from other talented developers. The competition tested my
        abilities in problem-solving and algorithm design, and it motivated me to continue pushing my limits in the tech
        industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another notable achievement was developing a <strong>Library Management System</strong> as my final project for a
        PHP course I took during my studies. The system allows users to search for books, borrow items, and manage their
        accounts. It was a practical way to apply my programming knowledge and create something that could be used by
        others in real life.

      <a href="#philosophy">Philosophy</a><hr style="color: white;">
      <p>
        My personal philosophy is rooted in the belief that learning never stops. I strive to embrace challenges, adapt to
        new environments, and continuously improve myself, both professionally and personally. I believe failure is an
        essential part of growth, as each setback provides valuable lessons that help me move forward with greater
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork. While individual effort is important, the collective
        strength of a team can produce extraordinary results. I am passionate about contributing my skills to projects
        where creativity and cooperation are at the forefront.
      </p>
      <p>
        My motto is simple: “Keep learning, keep growing.” Life is full of opportunities to discover new things, and I
        approach each day with curiosity and excitement for what lies ahead.

        “The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” – Steve Jobs
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This quote has always resonated with me. I believe that passion and dedication are the keys to success. When you
        truly love what you do, it doesn’t feel like work—it becomes a natural part of who you are, and you’ll constantly
        strive to improve and innovate. It's a reminder to pursue what excites and motivates you, because only then can you
        truly excel.

      <p>* According to OMOCAT, OMORI was originally named OMORIBOY and first appeared in his own blog, which was named after him and lasted from December 22nd, 2011 to March 14th, 2012.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* OMOCAT used the OMORIBOY blog for self-expression and to vent out their turbulent feelings as a troubled young adult. The character's loneliness also inspired OMOCAT to create a world of pure imagination</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* This version of OMORI is depicted as a depressed hikikomori, and appears much older in appearance. Some bits of this characterization would later be used for his original self SUNNY.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* Many posts there show OMORIBOY's inner thoughts about himself and the world around him. Some of his traits in the blog are used for his current portrayal in the final game, but toned down.</p>
      <p>* OMORI was originally planned to have an AFRAID emotion but this was scrapped, most likely due to OMORI being normally incapable of expressing fear. This was given to SUNNY instead in the final game. The 2018 Kickstarter demo's coding still contains data of OMORI's AFRAID emotion.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* OMORI was also meant to have a TOAST emotion when downed in battle, like with the other party members. This was replaced with a DEFEATED sprite in the full game's release. blog are used for his current portrayal in the final game, but toned down.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* The looping background for the FACES OF OMORI subarea contains a blurred version of OMORI's old battle faces from that build, with the unused AFRAID battle portrait included within the background.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;">* The final fight of the console-exclusive BASIL RUSH event subverts this by having OMORI actually becoming AFRAID, only after bringing the opponent down to 20% HEART or lower. The portrait used depicts a younger SUNNY's horrified reaction to something he shouldn't have seen.</p>
